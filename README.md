# TimeManagementApp
The intention for this app is to write lists and help manage time, functionally this may change/differ since this project is for practicing python.

Currently funtional: *Find all .txt files in the designated folder, *display files to GUI, *display file contents to GUI, *file editing

  **Notes for current features**: There is a Tkinter askFileDialog method which was not used for finding files but would have been easier. This is since I wanted to learn about finding all files in a directory and the intricacies behind it. To run the app without the console change the extension from .py to .pyw   

Currently WIP: *additional tools for editing files (Add numbering template and other quality of life features)
