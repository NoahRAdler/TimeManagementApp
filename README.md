# TimeManagementApp
The intention for this app is to write lists and help manage time, functionally this may change/differ since this project is for practicing python.

Currently funtional: *Find all .txt files in the designated folder, *display files to GUI, *display file contents to GUI

  **Notes for current features**: There is a Tkinter askFileDialog method which was not used for finding files but would have been easier. This is since I wanted to learn about finding all files in a directory and the intricacies behind it.   

Currently WIP: *file editing(GUI done)(Need functionality), *additional tools for editing files
