# TimeManagementApp
The intention for this app is to write lists and help manage time, functionally this may change/differ since this project is for practicing python.

Currently funtional: *Find all .txt files in the designated folder, *display files to GUI, *display file contents to GUI, *file editing, *some text editing tools and functionality


  **Notes for current features**: There is a Tkinter askFileDialog method which was not used for finding files but would have been easier. This is since I wanted to learn about finding all files in a directory and the intricacies behind it. To run the app without the console change the extension from .py to .pyw, also make sure 
to have a TodoAndReminders folder, which needs to contain at least 1 text file.    


Currently WIP: Adding ico/top image to app window(s) and finalizing project




Future plans: This project may see a future refactoring or a completely new version(as in a branch off), but after adding the ICO(s) and a once-over to clean up the code, this is being left alone for a while. As for closing thoughts, there could have been better use of OOP concepts and more effort to improve ease of use in the app. Despite that, there are quality sections of code, so this can be an ok tkinter reference going forward.
